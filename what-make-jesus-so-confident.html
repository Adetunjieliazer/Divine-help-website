			<p> 
    In today’s culture, Jesus is known for many things. He’s known for being humble, sacrificial, and the reason we celebrate Christmas. Though he is all of these things, we can often forget how confident and sure of himself Jesus really was. He never doubted himself, never changed himself to please other people. He never felt the need to prove how strong or capable he was. The following scriptures show that Jesus’ confidence came not from getting glory or from proving himself, but rather from his willingness to be weak, his focus on his greater purpose, and his love for other people. If you are feeling unsure of yourself or are constantly looking to others’ approval to get confident, these scriptures are for you.</p>

<p> <h4>Hebrews 4:15-16 (VOICE)</h4> 
For Jesus is not some high priest who has no sympathy for our weaknesses and flaws. He has already been tested in every way that we are tested; but He emerged victorious, without failing God. So let us step boldly to the throne of grace, where we can find mercy and grace to help when we need it most.</p>



<p> <h4>Hebrews 5:7 (TPT)</h4>
				During Christ’s days on earth he pleaded with God, praying with passion and with tearful agony that God would spare him from death.And because of his perfect devotion his prayer was answered and he was delivered.</p>




<p> <h4>John 5:41-44 (NLT)</h4>
				“Your approval means nothing to me, because I know you don’t have God’s love within you. For I have come to you in my Father’s name, and you have rejected me. Yet if others come in their own name, you gladly welcome them. No wonder you can’t believe! For you gladly honor each other, but you don’t care about the honor that comes from the one who alone is God</p>


<p> <h4>John 2:15-17 (TPT)</h4>
So Jesus found some rope and made it into a whip. Then he drove out every one of them and their animals from the courtyard of the temple, and he kicked over their tables filled with money, scattering it everywhere! And he shouted at the merchants, “Get these things out of here! Don’t you dare make my Father’s house into a center for merchandise!” That’s when his disciples remembered the Scripture: “I am consumed with a fiery passion to keep your house pure!”</p>



<p> <h4>John 6:37-38 (GW)</h4>
Everyone whom the Father gives me will come to me. I will never turn away anyone who comes to me. I haven’t come from heaven to do what I want to do. I’ve come to do what the one who sent me wants me to do.</p>



<p> <h4>Matthew 9:35-36 (VOICE)</h4>
Jesus went through many towns and villages. He taught in their synagogues. He preached the good news of the kingdom of God. He healed every disease and sickness. Whenever crowds came to Him, He had compassion for them because they were so deeply distraught, malaised, and heart-broken. They seemed to Him like lost sheep without a shepherd.</p>
