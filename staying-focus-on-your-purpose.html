			<p> 
   Believing and remembering that God has a purpose for our lives is sometimes the only thing that keeps us moving forward when life gets hard or when we are stuck in a sin. When we forget about the purpose of our lives we will stop wanting to live for God and the temporary pleasures of the world around us will seem incredibly enticing.</p>
<p>
Use the Scriptures below to gain conviction about how to find God’s purpose and stay focused on it.

<p> <h4> Romans 8:28 NIRV</h4>

We know that in all things God works for the good of those who love him. He appointed them to be saved in keeping with his purpose.</p>


<p><h4>
Romans‬ ‭10:4‬ ‭NLT‬‬</h4>

For Christ has already accomplished the purpose for which the law was given. As a result, all who believe in him are made right with God.</p>


<p><h4>
‭‭Acts‬ ‭4:28-31‬ ‭NIRV‬‬</h4>

They did what your power and purpose had already decided should happen. Now, Lord, consider the bad things they say they are going to do. Help us to be very bold when we speak your word. Stretch out your hand to heal. Do miraculous signs and wonders through the name of your holy servant Jesus.” After they prayed, the place where they were meeting was shaken. They were all filled with the Holy Spirit. They were bold when they spoke God’s word.</p>


<p><h4>
1 Corinthians 9:26-27 NLT</h4>

So I run with purpose in every step. I am not just shadowboxing. I discipline my body like an athlete, training it to do what it should. Otherwise, I fear that after preaching to others I myself might be disqualified.</p>


<p><h4>
‭Philippians‬ ‭2:1-2‬ ‭NLT</h4>

‬‬Is there any encouragement from belonging to Christ? Any comfort from his love? Any fellowship together in the Spirit? Are your hearts tender and compassionate? Then make me truly happy by agreeing wholeheartedly with each other, loving one another, and working together with one mind and purpose.</p>


<p><h4>
Philippians‬ ‭2:13‬ ‭NIRV‬‬</h4>

God is working in you. He wants your plans and your acts to be in keeping with his good purpose.</p>


<p><h4>
Romans 9:20-24 NIRV</h4>

But you are a mere human being. So who are you to talk back to God? Scripture says, “Can what is made say to the one who made it, ‘Why did you make me like this?’ ” ; Isn’t the potter free to make different kinds of pots out of the same lump of clay? Some are for special purposes. Others are for ordinary use. What if God chose to show his great anger? What if he chose to make his power known? But he put up with the people he was angry with. They were made to be destroyed. What if he put up with them to show the riches of his glory to other people? Those other people are the ones he shows his mercy to. He made them to receive his glory. We are those people. He has chosen us. We do not come only from the Jewish race. Many of us are not Jews.
</p>

<p><h4>
2 Timothy 2:20-22 NIRV</h4>

In a large house there are things made out of gold and silver. But there are also things made out of wood and clay. Some have special purposes. Others have common purposes. Suppose someone stays away from what is common. Then the Master will be able to use them for special purposes. They will be made holy. They will be ready to do any good work. Run away from the evil things that young people long for. Try hard to do what is right. Have faith, love and peace. Do these things together with those who call on the Lord from a pure heart.</p>


<p><h4>
1 Corinthians 3:7-9 NKJV</h4>

So then neither he who plants is anything, nor he who waters, but God who gives the increase. 8 Now he who plants and he who waters are one, and each one will receive his own reward according to his own labor. For we are God’s fellow workers; you are God’s field, you are God’s building.</p>


<p><h4>
‭‭Psalms‬ ‭57:2-3‬ ‭NLT‬‬</h4>

I cry out to God Most High, to God who will fulfill his purpose for me. He will send help from heaven to rescue me, disgracing those who hound me. Interlude My God will send forth his unfailing love and faithfulness.
