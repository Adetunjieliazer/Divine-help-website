			<p> 
    No matter your stage in life, it’s important to have faith for your future. When we don’t believe God has a plan for us we will try to take control of our own lives – which usually leads to anxiety and a host of other sins. Use these verses to build your faith in God’s plans for your future.</p>

<p> <h4>1 Corinthians 10:13 MSG</h4>
[13] No test or temptation that comes your way is beyond the course of what others have had to face. All you need to remember is that God will never let you down; he’ll never let you be pushed past your limit; he’ll always be there to help you come through it.</p>


<p><h4>
Psalm 31:14-15 NLT</h4>
[14] But I am trusting you, O LORD, saying, “You are my God!” [15] My future is in your hands.</p>


<p><h4>
Proverbs 31:25 NLT</h4>
 She is clothed with strength and dignity, and she laughs without fear of the future.</p>


<p><h4>
Jeremiah 29:11 NLT</h4>
 For I know the plans I have for you,” says the LORD. “They are plans for good and not for disaster, to give you a future and a hope.</p>


<p><h4>
Romans 8:38-39 NLT</h4>
[38] And I am convinced that nothing can ever separate us from God’s love. Neither death nor life, neither angels nor demons, neither our fears for today nor our worries about tomorrow-not even the powers of hell can separate us from God’s love. [39] No power in the sky above or in the earth below-indeed, nothing in all creation will ever be able to separate us from the love of God that is revealed in Christ Jesus our Lord.</p>


<p><h4>
Psalm 34:4-7 NLT</h4>
[4] I prayed to the LORD, and he answered me. He freed me from all my fears. [5] Those who look to him for help will be radiant with joy; no shadow of shame will darken their faces. [6] In my desperation I prayed, and the LORD listened; he saved me from all my troubles. [7] For the angel of the LORD is a guard; he surrounds and defends all who fear him.</p>


<p><h4>
Psalm 34:8-10 NLT</h4>
[8] Taste and see that the LORD is good. Oh, the joys of those who take refuge in him! [9] Fear the LORD, you his godly people, for those who fear him will have all they need. [10] Even strong young lions sometimes go hungry, but those who trust in the LORD will lack no good thing.</p>


<p><h4>
Psalm 37:3-5 AMP</h4>
[3] Trust (lean on, rely on, and be confident) in the Lord and do good; so shall you dwell in the land and feed surely on His faithfulness, and truly you shall be fed. [4] Delight yourself also in the Lord, and He will give you the desires and secret petitions of your heart. [5] Commit your way to the Lord roll and repose each care of your load on Him; trust (lean on, rely on, and be confident) also in Him and He will bring it to pass.</p>


<p><h4>
Matthew 6:33-34 AMP</h4>
[33] But seek (aim at and strive after) first of all His kingdom and His righteousness (His way of doing and being right), and then all these things taken together will be given you besides. [34] So do not worry or be anxious about tomorrow, for tomorrow will have worries and anxieties of its own. Sufficient for each day is its own trouble.</p>


<p><h4>
Matthew 6:33-34 Voice</h4>
[33] Seek first the kingdom of God and His righteousness, and then all these things will be given to you too. [34] So do not worry about tomorrow. Let tomorrow worry about itself. Living faithfully is a large enough task for today.</p>


<p><h4>
Proverbs 3:23-26 Voice</h4>
[23] Then each one of your steps will land securely on your life’s journey, and you will not trip or fall. [24] Your mind will be clear, free from fear; when you lie down to rest, you will be refreshed by sweet sleep. [25] Stay calm; there is no need to be afraid of a sudden disaster or to worry when calamity strikes the wicked, [26] For the Eternal is always there to protect you. He will safeguard your each and every step.</p>


<p><h4>
Zechariah 8:6-8 MSG</h4>
[6] A Message from God-of-the-Angel-Armies: “Do the problems of returning and rebuilding by just a few survivors seem too much? But is anything too much for me? Not if I have my say.” [7-8] A Message from God-of-the-Angel-Armies: “I’ll collect my people from countries to the east and countries to the west. I’ll bring them back and move them into Jerusalem. They’ll be my people and I’ll be their God. I’ll stick with them and do right by them.”</p>


<p><h4>
Matthew 17:20-21 MSG</h4>
[20-21] “Because you’re not yet taking God seriously,” said Jesus. “The simple truth is that if you had a mere kernel of faith, a poppy seed, say, you would tell this mountain, ‘Move!’ and it would move. There is nothing you wouldn’t be able to tackle.”</p>


<p><h4>
Matthew 17:20-21 Voice</h4>
[20] Jesus: Because you have so little faith. I tell you this: if you had even a faint spark of faith, even faith as tiny as a mustard seed, you could say to this mountain, “Move from here to there,” and because of your faith, the mountain would move. If you had just a sliver of faith, you would find nothing impossible. [21] [But this kind is not realized except through much prayer and fasting.]</p>


<p><h4>
Mark 10:26-27 Voice</h4>
[26] The disciples looked around at each other, whispering. Disciples (aloud to Jesus): Then who can be liberated? [27] Jesus (smiling and shaking His head): For human beings it is impossible, but not for God: God makes everything possible.</p>


<p><h4>
Luke 18:27 Voice</h4>
 Jesus: Remember, what is humanly impossible is possible with God.</p>


<p><h4>
Psalm 119:59,133 NCV</h4>
 I thought about my life, and I decided to follow your rules. [133] Guide my steps as you promised; don’t let any sin control me.</p>


<p><h4>
Psalm 94:19 NCV</h4>
 I was very worried, but you comforted me and made me happy.</p>


<p><h4>
Romans 15:13 NCV</h4>
 I pray that the God who gives hope will fill you with much joy and peace while you trust in him. Then your hope will overflow by the power of the Holy Spirit.</p>


<p> <h4>
Psalm 29:11 NLT</h4>
 The LORD gives his people strength. The LORD blesses them with peace.
